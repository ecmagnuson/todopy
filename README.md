This will hopefully be a functional version of the todo.txt project.

I want to be able to:
have a directory with 2 files: todo and done
I want to make a python script that can read standard input
and print that standard input to a file.

It must:
add to the new line every time I add to the file, never overwriting 
accept multiple arguments - add and do
when I add to the file it must add to a new row
when I do a task I want it to remove it from the file and then remove that row
shifting everything in the file down.
It then must take that line and add it to the done file. 

Can expand upon this later at some point
